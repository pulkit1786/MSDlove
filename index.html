He participated in many sports activities at the school level from where his football coach recognize his talent as a wicket-keeper. He was selected in his school cricket team as a wicket keeper then he played some good knocks as a batsman. His coach motivated him to play more cricket as he was aware that he will do something big in the cricket. MS Dhoni worked really hard on his batting and wicket-keeping. He got selected for his state team. It was tough time for him as he was also doing a job and managing both together was getting difficult for him. He took a bold decision by quitting his government job and just to focus on the cricket.</p>
